A microservice for scaling S3-stored images on the fly.

## Usage

TO DO

## Installation and deployment

Clone this repository, and install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

ðŸ’¡ Note: SHARP binaries are built for Linux X64 platform, since that's what's running on AWS Lambda. This means these binaries cannot be used locally on MacOS.
For future reference, the following one-liner is used to install Sharp:

```
npm_config_platform=linux npm_config_arch=x64 yarn add sharp
```

Configure a `.env` file, based on `.env.example`.

Deploy using serverless:

```
serverless deploy --stage development
```

Note the URL in Serverless' terminal output.

Use that URL when configuring redirect rules in the bucket's website configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "Condition": {
      "HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals": "403"
    },
    "Redirect": {
      "HostName": "0123456789.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com",
      "HttpRedirectCode": "307",
      "Protocol": "https",
      "ReplaceKeyPrefixWith": "default/resize?key="
    }
  }
]
```

Note that the value for `HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals` might be `403` or `404` based on your bucket and CloudFront settings.
